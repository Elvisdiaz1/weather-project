# Weather Tracker Project

## Description

This project is a weather tracker application designed for viewing the weather at various locations. The reason this project was made was to create a weather application that a person can use to look at what the weather is on the current day and the next five days. The application has a search history that shows the locations searched and shows the weather data from those locations when the corresponding button is pressed. This allows the user to plan trips to the locations they searched. This project has allowed me to learn how to use apis to recieve data and to use the data to create applications such as these.

## Installation

To install this application, you need clone the repository. To clone the repository, you go to the green button on the repository that says "< > Code". Then you can choose to copy either the https url or the ssh url if you have a ssh key. After you copy the link, then you go to your terminal on your computer and in the terminal, you change the current directory to the directory you want to place the cloned repository in and then you type "git clone" and paste the url. Finally, you hit enter and the repository will be on your machine and you can open the index.html in your browser by right clicking the html in the directory and choosing which browser to open it in.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
To use this application, you need to put the full name of the city you are looking for and the two digit country code in thier respective search bars. The country codes are always the same as the normal abbreviations, for example "US" is the same as its country code "US" but England's country code is "GB" for "Great Britain", so look up the country code on Google to be sure you are putting the correct code. Then after putting in the infomation and hitting the "search" button, you will see the current day weather data and the weather data for the next five days. The city you looked up will be placed in the search history section so anytime you want to view that city's weather data, just press the button of the city you want. You can enter another city and country code and view its weather data. That city will be placed in the search history alongside the other city or cities previously searched, allowing you to view its data whenever you want.
